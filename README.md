# DeepLearning
Created this repository to implement the very underlying mathematical concepts.

I ihave implemented from very basic McCullouh-Pit's Neuron to Encoder-Decoder models.

Sequence goes :

**1.Feed Forward Networks** [[notebook](https://github.com/siddhantjain07/DeepLearning/blob/master/FeedForawrdNetwork.ipynb)]

**2.Vectorized version - FFNs** [[notebook](https://github.com/siddhantjain07/DeepLearning/blob/master/VectorizedFeedForwardNetowrks.ipynb)]

**3.Backpropagation** [[notebook](https://github.com/siddhantjain07/DeepLearning/blob/master/ScalarBackpropagation.ipynb)]

**4.Learning Algorithms** [[notebook](https://github.com/siddhantjain07/DeepLearning/blob/master/LearningAlgorithms.ipynb)]

**5.GD Algorithms** [[notebook](https://github.com/siddhantjain07/DeepLearning/blob/master/VectorizedGDAlgos.ipynb)]

**6.Activation and Initialization** [[notebook](https://github.com/siddhantjain07/DeepLearning/blob/master/Weight_Initialization_Activation_Functions.ipynb)]

**7.PyTorch** [[notebook](https://github.com/siddhantjain07/DeepLearning/blob/master/PyTorch.ipynb)]

**8.CNNs in PyTorch** [[notebook](https://github.com/siddhantjain07/DeepLearning/blob/master/PyTorchCNN.ipynb)]
